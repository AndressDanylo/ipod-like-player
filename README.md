This project was inspired by [tvillarete/ipod-classic-js](https://github.com/tvillarete/ipod-classic-js) and aims to recreate iPod experience in browser using pure JS.

Unlike [tvillarete/ipod-classic-js](https://github.com/tvillarete/ipod-classic-js), this project focuses on working with local files rather than streaming services, providing a fully offline experience.
